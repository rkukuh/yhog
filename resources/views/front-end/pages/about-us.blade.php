					<p>The Yayasan HOG Indonesian Chapter (YHOG) is a registered charity of bike riders and non-riders alike. The Chapter was incorporated in 1987 and is the first Harley Davidson Owners Group Chapter to be registered outside of the United States. Since our incorporation, we have focused our fund-raising efforts on helping orphanages, and in particular supporting facial reconstructive surgery for infants and children born with harelip or cleft palate defects. By the end of this year YHOG will have helped change the lives of over 3,250 Indonesian children.</p>
		
					<p>The incidence of such birth defects remains high in Indonesia, and many families cannot afford the surgery needed. Yet, without these quite simple operations, these children can become outcasts in their own society and face a future of even greater hardship and struggle. Your assistance to these children truly helps change lives for the better.</p>

					<p>For many years we have worked closely in support of Dr. Gentur and his surgical team. Dr. Gentur was until recently the Head of the Reconstructive and Plastic Surgery Unit at the Cipto Mangukusumo Hospital in Jakarta, and is widely respected both in Indonesia and abroad for his wealth of knowledge in the reconstructive surgery field, and in particular for his pioneering work in Indonesia in operating on babies and infants. Since his retirement, Dr. Gentur has established the Gentur Cleft Foundation, where he and his team can continue to provide their surgical time and expertise, while YHOG covers all other hospital and associated medical expenses, from transporting children and families to the hospital through the provision of post-operative care and medication.</p>
